1. Develop a java class with a instance variable M1 (HashMap) create a method saveCountryCapital(String CountryName, String capital) , the method should add the passed country and capital as key/value in the map M1 and return the Map (M1).

Key- Country Value - Capital

India Delhi

Japan Tokyo

2. Develop a method getCapital(String CountryName) which returns the capital for the country passed, from the Map M1 created in step 1.

3. Develop a method getCountry(String capitalName) which returns the country for the capital name, passed from the Map M1 created in step 1.

4. Develop a method which iterates through the map M1 and creates another map M2 with Capital as the key and value as Country and returns the Map M2.

Key – Capital Value – Country

Delhi India

Tokyo Japan

5. Develop a method which iterates through the map M1 and creates an ArrayList with all the Country names stored as keys. This method should return the ArrayList.

NOTE: You can test the methods using a main method.

• StudentName: Valid value can contain maximum 20 letters in uppercase

• Standard : Valid values are Roman Letters representing I to X(I, II, III, IV….IX, X)
